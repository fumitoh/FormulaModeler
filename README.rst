FormulaModeler
==============
Formula Modeler (FML) is a structured data modeling tool for 
building mathematical models in Excel VBA  
and performing numerical calculations. 
FML is an open-source Excel add-in written entirely in VBA.

Motivation
==========
It is hard to maintain the integrity of complex models such 
as actuarial models on 2-dimensional spreadsheets, 
as those models get cluttered with lots of formulas.
By writing your model in Excel VBA using FML, 
you can build beautifully structured,
multi-level, multi-dimensional data models with high transparency.
Not only simple batch processing or loop calculations, 
but also flexible control of dynamic calculations can be achieved.
Formula Modeler especially suites actuarial
applications, and is accompanied by the standard life insurance library,
by which you can quickly calculate insurance premium and reserving
rates and build complete actuarial projection models.

How It Works
============
To develop a model using Formula Modeler, you can write Formulas
in Excel VBA by following simple rules. A Formula here means a set
of variables and associated code that operates on the variables, 
such as mathematical expressions.

To run a model, you create a model by writing a VBA macro and 
register Formulas to the model . The results can be output to
a text file or Excel sheets.

Variables of Formula Modeler can have a multi-dimensional and
multi-level  hierarchy structure. For a complex model,
multiple Formulas can be created, and combined into a model.

Since a model is composed of separable Formulas, one Formula
can be shared by multiple models for different purposes,
allowing efficient modeling and proper management of the models.
